# Snoopy Landing Page

A simple under construction landing page that features Charles M. Schulz's iconic Snoopy Beagle. A live example is available [here](https://willtheorangeguy.github.io/Snoopy-Landing-Page/).

## How to Set Up
1. Dowload the latest release here: [Version 1.2](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/Snoopy-Landing-Page/releases/tag/1.2)
2. Delete the `README.md` and `LICENSE` files.
3. Edit the `index.html` file in the following three places:
    - Line 15, Column 51: Where it says _%insert_time_here%_, replace the placeholder with the time you expect your website to be done. I suggest an approximate date like "the end of 2018" or "in the spring". 
    - Line 15, Column 135: Where it says _%link_to_GitHub_profile_here%_, replace the placeholder with a link to your company's GitHub page.
    - Line 15, Column 242: Where is says _%your_email%_, replace the placeholder with your email address.
4. Copy the `index.html` and `snoopy.jpg` file to your website server and point your domain to the `index.html` file.
5. You're all set!
